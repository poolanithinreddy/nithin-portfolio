## üîß Recommended Improvements

### High Priority
1. Replace `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` component
   - Files: work/[slug]/page.tsx, blog/[slug]/page.tsx
   - Benefit: Automatic optimization, lazy loading, better LCP

### Medium Priority
2. Add loading states/skeleton screens
   - Already created: Skeleton, CardSkeleton components
   - Benefit: Better perceived performance

3. Implement service worker for offline support
   - Use next-pwa or Workbox
   - Benefit: PWA capabilities, offline mode

### Low Priority
4. Add analytics for accessibility features
   - Track keyboard navigation usage
   - Track screen reader usage
   - Benefit: Data-driven improvements

## üìù Notes

- All major accessibility features are implemented
- Motion preferences are respected globally
- Focus states are enhanced with custom ring colors
- Keyboard navigation is fully supported
- Screen reader support is comprehensive
- High contrast mode is supported
- Print styles are included

**Next Step:** Run Lighthouse audit to get baseline scores and identify any remaining optimizations.
