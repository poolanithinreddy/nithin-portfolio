## Systems engineer with academic cyber defense roots

I build platforms that keep classrooms, analysts, and product teams shipping safely—from distributed VMware lab automation to realtime AI experiences. UMBC’s CyberRange Portal remains the crown jewel: I owned the full stack (Next.js, Node/Express, Mongo/Postgres, VMware vCenter automation, SAML/SSO, Docker/NGINX, observability) and delivered production reliability for faculty and students.
