## Context & Goals

Interview coaching platforms often lack live, contextual feedback. This project delivers a browser-based interviewer that listens, scores, and surfaces coaching tips in real time without sacrificing privacy or stability.

## Architecture Overview

- **Client**: Next.js front-end with WebRTC publisher, noise gating, and timeline UI.
- **Signaling**: Node server establishing WebRTC sessions, handling TURN/STUN negotiation, and streaming audio frames to evaluators.
- **Inference layer**: GPT-based evaluators running in parallel, enriching transcripts with rubric checks (communication, technical depth, empathy).
- **Storage**: Redis for transient session data, PostgreSQL for final reports, highlights, and improvement suggestions.

## Highlights

- Built adaptive scoring that adjusts rubrics mid-session based on candidate responses and job role.
- Implemented safe-words and privacy controls; sessions can redact sensitive topics before saving transcripts.
- Added playback controls that pair video segments with constructive coaching cards.

## Next Steps

- Expand to support collaborative interviewer panels with shared annotations.
- Integrate HRIS exports to close the loop on performance tracking.
