## Context & Goals

Built FluCast during a public health research initiative to help epidemiologists anticipate respiratory surges. Needed reliable ingestion from CDC ILINet APIs, configurable regional models, and dashboards for health departments.

## Architecture

- **Data ingestion**: Scheduled ETLs pull CDC feeds, sanitize anomalies, and persist to PostgreSQL + S3 history buckets.
- **Modeling**: PyTorch LSTM ensemble with feature engineering for seasonality, weather, and mobility metrics. Azure ML orchestrates retrains.
- **Serving**: FastAPI inference service with caching and guardrails that expose forecasts and confidence bands to the Next.js frontend.
- **Visualization**: Next.js dashboard with map overlays, scenario comparisons, and PDF export for weekly reporting.

## Challenges & Wins

- Automated monitoring detects concept drift and sends alerts if confidence intervals widen beyond thresholds.
- Implemented reproducible experiment tracking using MLflow, enabling quick audits of model changes.
- Added region-level overrides so public health analysts can tweak interventions and see projections instantly.

## What Iâ€™d do next

- Expand to include wastewater and school absence data for better leading indicators.
- Introduce uncertainty-aware ensembles and quantile regression for richer decision support.
