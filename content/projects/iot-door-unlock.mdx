## Context & Goals

Built an access control proof-of-concept for smart offices. Gateways must securely communicate with the cloud while maintaining local authorizations during outages.

## Architecture

- **Edge device**: Raspberry Pi running Rust/Node hybrid service managing relay control, keypad input, and local caching.
- **Messaging**: MQTT topics with mutual TLS; AWS IoT Core handles device registry, policies, and fleet jobs.
- **Cloud services**: Node.js API with DynamoDB storing credential assignments, CloudWatch metrics, and SNS push notifications.
- **Mobile**: React Native app for unlock requests, audit log review, and admin actions.

## Wins

- Implemented rolling credential cache with AES encryption and tamper detection.
- Added OTA update pipeline with staged rollouts and health checks.
- Observability via Grafana dashboards and alerting on unusual unlock patterns.

## Future work

- Add biometric reader integrations and SOC2 logging bundles.
- Support multi-site deployments with regional failover.
