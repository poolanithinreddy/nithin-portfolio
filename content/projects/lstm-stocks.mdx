## Context & Goals

Personal research lab for equities forecasting with a focus on reproducibility. Provides a workflow where data scientists can prototype models, run CI-backed evaluations, and visualize results in dashboards.

## Architecture

- **Data ingestion**: Batch jobs pull price data, fundamentals, and sentiment, storing them in Parquet with metadata catalogs.
- **Model training**: TensorFlow LSTM models, hyperparameter sweeps via Python scripts, and Dockerized workloads ready for cloud scaling.
- **Vector search**: Redis Stack stores embeddings for fundamental similarity, powering peer analysis.
- **Frontend**: Next.js dashboards for equity watchlists, performance attribution, and error analysis.

## Highlights

- GitHub Actions orchestrate nightly training/backtesting with result publishing to dashboards.
- Experiment registry built with SQLite + Prisma for fast comparisons.
- Docker Compose environment mirrors CI runs, making local iteration trivial.

## Whatâ€™s next

- Port inference layer to ONNX Runtime for faster scoring.
- Integrate with broker APIs for paper trading.
