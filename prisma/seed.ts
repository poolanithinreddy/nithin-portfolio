      description: `# CyberRange Portal — End-to-End Platform for Cybersecurity Labs

## Overview

The CyberRange Portal is a production system that provisions isolated virtual lab environments for UMBC cybersecurity courses. It delivers full-stack workflows—class and exercise management, automated VM lifecycle, SSO integration, and operational visibility—so instructors can teach securely at scale while students get reliable, &ldquo;just-works&rdquo; lab instances.

## Problem & Goals

**Before:** Instructors had to manually set up VMs or rely on one-off scripts. Provisioning was slow and error-prone; access controls were inconsistent; support requests spiked at semester start.

**Goals:**
- One click per class to provision/tear down labs
- Least-privilege access with auditable actions
- Reduce TA load via runbooks and self-serve status
- Be production-grade (TLS, observability, safe rollouts)

## My Role: Full-Stack + Platform Owner

### Frontend
React/Next.js dashboards for classes, lab uploads, real-time status; role-aware UX and validation.

### Backend
Node/Express APIs with RBAC, audit trails, background workers; MongoDB data models.

### Authentication
SAML SSO mapped to UMBC IdP roles; secure cookies + CSRF hardening.

### Automation
VMware vCenter VM lifecycle using Python/Node workers; golden templates + post-provisioning; jump-server SSH policy; credential rotation.

### Operations
Docker/Compose, NGINX with TLS and canonicalization; health checks, logs, metrics; authoring runbooks and student guides.

### Client
Next.js/React SPA with server components where helpful. Role-aware UI surfaces only permitted actions (e.g., "Provision Class" for faculty). Inline validation and human-readable errors reduce support tickets.

### API / Control-Plane
Node.js / Express service exposes REST endpoints for classes, exercises, students, provisioning jobs, and status. RBAC (faculty, TA, student, admin) enforced server-side; audit logs appended for sensitive actions (provision, destroy, sudo ops).

### Automation Workers
Python + Node workers handle long-running VM operations, talking to VMware vCenter: clone from golden templates, run post-provision scripts (network config, agents), and enforce restricted shells where needed. Credential rotation and jump-host SSH policies harden access.

### Data Layer
MongoDB (and in some modules PostgreSQL) models for classes, labs, user roles, job queue, and audit events.

### Edge / Delivery
NGINX in front for TLS, canonical domains, health checks, and static asset caching. Docker/Compose for repeatable deploys on Linux hosts.

### Observability & Ops
Standardized logs/metrics hooks for API and workers; admin runbooks and student lab guides for smoother onboarding.

## Flow: Provision a Class Lab (Happy Path)

1. **Instructor creates a class & exercise** in the portal (Next.js UI → Express API)
2. **SSO check (SAML)** maps IdP attributes → local RBAC; session established via secure cookies with CSRF protection on mutating routes
3. **Instructor clicks &ldquo;Provision&rdquo;** → API enqueues a job (MongoDB)
4. **Worker picks the job**, calls vCenter to clone from golden template, attaches networks, and runs post-provision scripts
5. **Worker registers output** (VM IDs, IPs, credentials place-holders) and marks ready; restricted shells/SSH policies applied
6. **UI polls/streams job updates** → real-time status card shows &ldquo;Ready&rdquo;

**Teardown** mirrors this flow: de-register students, snapshot or destroy VMs, and archive audit logs.

## Security Model

- **SAML SSO** with UMBC IdP → role mapping to faculty / student / TA / admin; reduces manual provisioning
- Sessions use **HttpOnly, Secure cookies**
- **CSRF protection** on POST/PATCH/DELETE
- **RBAC + Audit trails** on sensitive API routes; all provisioning events are append-only
- **Network boundaries**: jump-server SSH policies; restricted shells; credential rotation for VM accounts
- **Edge hardening**: NGINX TLS, canonical host enforcement

## Data Model (Condensed)

- **User**: id, role, SSO subject, profile
- **Class**: term, course code, roster, facultyId
- **Exercise**: classId, artifact (OVA/template id), constraints, grading flags
- **LabInstance**: userId, exerciseId, vmRef, status, connection info
- **Job**: type (provision/destroy), payload, status, logs
- **AuditEvent**: actor, action, target, time, metadata

## DevOps & Delivery

- **Docker/Compose** for API, workers, and UI; NGINX reverse-proxy with TLS & health checks
- **Canonicalization** ensures a single scheme/host
- **Observability**: structured logs + basic metrics for API request latency, worker job durations, and vCenter errors
- **Runbooks & Guides**: admin procedures (provisioning windows, rollback steps, how to rotate credentials) and student lab guides

## Results & Impact

✅ **Operationally reliable** provisioning of isolated lab VMs across courses

✅ **Reduced manual work** for instructors/IT; faster starts each semester

✅ **Security posture improved** with SAML SSO, server-side RBAC, CSRF hardening, restricted shells, and credential rotation

✅ **100+ VMs/week** provisioned with **90% faster** lab setup time

✅ **Onboarding reduced** from weeks to **<1 minute** with SSO

✅ **Zero PII incidents** while maintaining **FERPA compliance**

✅ Express APIs with RBAC, audit trails, background workers, and MongoDB models

✅ SAML SSO + secure session cookies + CSRF defenses; IdP role mapping

## Problem

Faculty needed a reliable way to provision isolated lab VMs for cybersecurity courses without manual setup or long lead times. The solution had to be secure, observable, and simple enough for TAs to operate.

## Users & Success Criteria

* **Instructors/TAs:** create classes, upload labs, monitor progress and VM status.
* **Students:** one-click lab access with SSO.
* **IT/Ops:** consistent, auditable provisioning; safe teardown.

Success = <10-minute class setup, predictable VM lifecycles, zero credential leaks, and smooth SSO onboarding.

**Key flows**

* **Auth:** SAML SSO (UMBC IdP) → secure session cookies → role mapping (faculty/student) → CSRF-hardened forms.
* **Provisioning:** instructors choose template → worker talks to vCenter → "golden template" clone → post-provision scripts (restricted shells, credential rotation) → status back to UI.
* **Ops:** health checks, logs/metrics; runbooks for admins/TA onboarding. 

## Data Model & API Notes

* **Core entities:** \`User\`, \`Course\`, \`Lab\`, \`VMInstance\`, \`Job\`, \`AuditLog\`.
* **Patterns:** soft deletes; idempotent jobs; per-lab quotas and teardown windows; audit trails on privileged actions.
* **Performance:** background workers and retriable jobs prevent "spinner" UX and make provisioning resilient to vCenter hiccups.

## Security & Compliance

* SAML/SSO + RBAC; signed cookies only; CSRF tokens; strict CORS; least-privilege service accounts on vCenter; per-lab network policies; HTTPS everywhere via NGINX + auto-renewed certs. 

## DevOps & Deployment

* Docker Compose for services; NGINX for TLS, canonical host, gzip/brotli, and health routing.
* Structured logging and metrics hooks for reliability dashboards. 

## Measurable Impact

* **Provision time**: minutes instead of manual hours.
* **Onboarding**: fewer instructor issues via runbooks + SSO.
* **Ops**: safer lifecycles with auditability and automatic teardown. 

## What I'd add next

* Per-lab snapshot/restore; "budget" guardrails; self-service analytics (VM hours, lab completion); async webhooks back to LMS.`,
